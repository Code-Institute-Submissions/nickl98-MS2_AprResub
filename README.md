[View the live project here.](https://nickl98.github.io/MS2)

For this project I decied to make a fun lttle matching game with diffrent types of technology you come across in your day-to-day life. You got 100 seconds to match all the cards with its correspoding cards. At first glacne you may think its not the hardest game you may come across however, the cards change location everytime you start over. I also added in some realxing low-fi background music; don't worry if your not into low-fi you have the option to mute! Well, enjoy take a break and enjoy the game!

### Testing Section


#### Frequent User Goals

- As a User, I would want each user to haave fun while they play the game! In hopes of them coming back along and playing new versions of the game!

-   Also after being a frequesnt


  
### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested with Google Chrome Dev Tools.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as 
    Desktop (1600x992px), Laptop (1280x802px ), Ipad (768x1024px), iPhone 5 (320x480px). 
-   Friends and family members were asked to play the game and give thier insight in what they liked.
One request they would love to see is the local scoreboard/ global scoreboard. 

### Manual Testing
-   When working on the game I ran into a issue not being able to view the game on certian devices.
So after some digging around I came across a Zoom property where the div is zoomed out and then the game board is able to be viewd on any decive.
-   When formating on certian devices I found out it was a easier process using bootstrap elements as much as possible. When having more of those elements it led me to using less css code. 
### Known Bugs

-   Eachtime the user restarts the game and had the background music muted, you will have to click  the mute button again.
-   Certian decive displays may experice issues on the directions being squezzed in. (modern Iphone models)
-   In the javascript valdation thier are some warnings but no major issues. Just a warning over "=>".
-   In the html valadation there were some warnings about the button class, but was the only way I could use the button in the navbar.




## Life Cycle

-   ### Design
    -   #### Color Scheme
        -   The two main colors used are white, purple, blue, gray and tan.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Luckiest Guy font is the main font used throughout the site.
